* Introduction 
This seminar discusses basic elements of concerning the protection of commercial goodwill under the common law action of "passing off".  It also introduces two slightly more "exotic" IP rights regarding image rights (IR) and geographical indications (GIs).   

* Seminar Questions

** [Q1] Unregistred Marks
How do we protect unregistered trade marks?

** [Q2] Elements of Passing Off 
What is the action of “passing off”? What are the essential elements of “passing off”?

** [Q3] Foreign Goodwill
Can a foreign trader bring an action of passing off in England? Has the internet had an impact on foreign goodwill?

** [Q4] Extended Passing Off 
What is “extended passing off”? What is its use? Can you give some examples?

** [Q5] Scope of Passing Off
Has the scope of passing off been broadened in /Irvine and Tidswell Ltd v Talksport Ltd/ and/or /Fenty v Arcadia Group Brands Ltd/?

** [Q6] "Image Rights" 
What are the possible legal routes to protect the so-called “image rights” in the UK? How does the Bailiwick of Guernsey protect image
rights? What are the criteria for registration under Image Rights (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Ordinance of 2012?

** [Q7] Right of Publicity
What is the right of publicity in the US context? How did it start in the US? (See /O'Brien v. Pabst Sales/ 1941 and /Haelan Laboratories v. Topps Chewing Gum/ 1953) Why is Professor Mel Nimmer 1954 article so important in laying the foundation for the right of publicity? Which IP
theory does Nimmer use to justify his claim? Do other scholars (such as Kwall, Maddow, McKenna ) agree with Nimmer?

** [Q8] Geographical Indications and TRIPS
What are Geographical Indications (GIs)? What is a key difference between Art. 22 and Art. 23 of the TRIPs Agreement? How can Art. 23 be
