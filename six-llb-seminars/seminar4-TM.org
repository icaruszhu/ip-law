* Introduction
What do trade mark law protect? Should it protect brands or branded images? This seminar explores many difficult issues concerning the registratbility of marks, legal protection of brands and, most fundamentally, the changing rationale behind TM law in its social context.

* Seminar Questions

** [Q1] Subject Matter of TM Law
What is the subject matter of trade mark law? How is this subject matter defined under current UK trade mark law? What does the /Dyson Ltd v Registrar of Trade Marks/ ruling tell us?

** [Q2] Essential Function
What are the essential function and the extended functions of trade mark? What is Schechter's view on the rational basis of trade mark protection? What is Litman's view on the advertising function of trade
marks?

** [Q3] TM and Brand
What is the difference between a “trade mark” and a “brand”? What is “anthropological marketing”? What is the semiotic analysis of trade marks?

** [Q4] Unconventional Marks
Can you register “smells” as trade marks? How about “sound” marks and “colour” marks?

** [Q5] Absolute Grounds
What are the absolute grounds for refusal of registration under Trade Marks Act 1994? What is the “acquired distinctiveness” proviso about? Is Cadbury entitled to register the purple colour as its trade mark? (When did Cadbury start to use the “purple” chocolate wrappers?)

** [Q6] Slogan as TM
Can slogans be protected by trade mark law? What is the mark applied for in /Audi AG v OHIM/ about? What is the result of the case and why? In general, how may IP law give protection to short verbal text?

** [Q7] Relative Grounds
What are relative grounds for refusal of registration? What is their relationship with infringement provisions?

** [Q8] "Dilution"
What is meant by “dilution” of marks with reputation? What are the anti-dilution provisions in UK and EU trade mark law? Is there a difference between “detriments” and “taking advantage?” What are regarded as “famous” marks?

** [Q9] "Due Cause" Defence
What is the “due cause” in anti-dilution lawsuits? What can we learn from the /Leidseplein Beheer/ ruling?
