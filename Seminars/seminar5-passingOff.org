*[Questions]*

[Q1] How do we protect unregistered trade marks?

[Q2] What is the action of “passing off”? What are the essential
elements of “passing off”?

[Q3] Can a foreign trader bring an action of passing off in England? Has
the internet had an impact on foreign goodwill?

[Q4] What is “extended passing off”? What is its use? Can you give some
examples?

[Q5] Has the reach of passing off been broadened in /*Irvine and
Tidswell Ltd v Talksport Ltd and/or* Fenty v Arcadia Group Brands
Ltd*?*/

[Q6] What are the possible legal routes to protect the so-called “image
rights” in the UK? How does the Bailiwick of Guernsey protect image
rights? What are the criteria for registration under Image Rights
(Bailiwick of Guernsey) Ordinance of 2012?

[Q7] What is the right of publicity in the US context? How did it start
in the US? (See /O'Brien v. Pabst Sales/ 1941 and /Haelan Laboratories
v. Topps Chewing Gum/ 1953) Why is Professor Mel Nimmer 1954 article so
important in laying the foundation for the right of publicity? Which IP
theory does Nimmer use to justify his claim? Do other scholars (such as
Kwall, Maddow, McKenna ) agree with Nimmer?

[Q8] What are Geographical Indications (GIs)? What is a key difference
between Art. 22 and Art. 23 of the TRIPs Agreement? How can Art. 23 be
justified?

[Q9] How are GIs protected within the EU? What is the legal dispute
concerning “Melton Mowbray Pie” about?
